## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Neural Style Transfer Studio locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HackWGaveesh/Neural-Style-Transfer-Studio.git
    cd Your-Repository-Name
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have the `requirements.txt` file in your project directory.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The `requirements.txt` should contain:
    ```
    streamlit==1.45.1
   tensorflow==2.18.0
   tensorflow-hub==0.16.1
   numpy==2.0.2
   pillow==11.2.1
    ```

## üìÅ Directory Structure

* `StyleGan_Main.py`: The main Python script for the Streamlit application.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required for the project.
* `Styles/`: This directory should contain predefined style images (e.g., `vangogh.jpg`, `monet.jpg`). The application loads styles from this folder for the "Predefined Styles" option. Make sure to populate this folder with your desired style images.
* `.gitignore` (Recommended): To exclude unnecessary files from version control.
* `README.md`: This file.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

Once you have completed the setup and installation:

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run StyleGan_Main.py
    ```
4.  Streamlit will typically open the application automatically in your default web browser. If not, it will display a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) that you can open manually.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Upload Content Image:** In the "üì∏ Upload & Create" tab, use the file uploader under "üì§ Content Image" to select the photo you want to style.
2.  **Select Style:**
    * **Predefined Styles:** Choose "üé® Predefined Styles". You can opt for "Single Style" or "Multiple Styles" selection mode. Click on the style images from the gallery to select/deselect them.
    * **Custom Style:** Choose "üñåÔ∏è Custom Style" and upload your own style image.
3.  **Advanced Settings (Optional):** Expand the "‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Settings" section to adjust output quality or try preserving original colors.
4.  **Generate Artwork:** Once a content image and at least one style are selected, click the "üñåÔ∏è Generate Artwork" button.
5.  **View and Download:** After processing, your styled images will appear in the "‚ú® Your Masterpieces" section. You can download individual images or all images as a ZIP file.

## üìù Notes

* For optimal results, use high-quality content and style images.
* Processing time can vary depending on the size and complexity of the images, as well as your system's performance.
* The "Preserve Original Colors" feature is experimental and results may vary.
